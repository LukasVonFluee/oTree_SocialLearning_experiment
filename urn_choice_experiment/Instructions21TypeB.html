                <li> Finally, you will have to correctly enter the {{ player.session.length_multi_digit }}-digit number that is
                    shown to you again. This will be the exact same number that was shown to you before. So, your task is not to memorize it
                    the first time it is shown to you but simply to enter the number that is shown to you again correctly. There
                    is no deception in this experiment. </li>
