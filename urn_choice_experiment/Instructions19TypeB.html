                <li> In every block, after you have been shown the multi digit number, you will see a new picture that gives you useful information for your choice between the two urns.</li>
                <li> You will see information telling you that you are either very likely or very unlikely to
                    <b>share the winning color with your own group</b>, the
                    {% if participant.group_assignment == C.GROUP_TRIANGLE %} <b>triangle</b>
                    {% elif participant.group_assignment == C.GROUP_SQUARE %} <b>square</b>
                    {% endif %} group, in a given block.</li>
                <li> This information will be helpful to you because you will simultaneously see <b>how many Type A</b> participants have
                    chosen the left or right urn in the final round of a block after they had four rounds to find out which urn contains
                    more marbles of their winning color. </li>
                <li> More precisely, you will either see the choices of <b>your own group</b>, the
                    {% if participant.group_assignment == C.GROUP_TRIANGLE %} triangle
                    {% elif participant.group_assignment == C.GROUP_SQUARE %} square
                    {% endif %} group, <b>or of the other group</b>, the
                    {% if participant.group_assignment == C.GROUP_TRIANGLE %} square
                    {% elif participant.group_assignment == C.GROUP_SQUARE %} triangle
                    {% endif %} group, in a given block.</li>
                <li> How likely you are to share the winning color with your own group, and whether you observe your own group's choices or
                    the other group's, <b>can change between blocks</b>, so pay close attention to the information you are shown in every block. </li>
                <li> In the following, we show you four examples. </li>
