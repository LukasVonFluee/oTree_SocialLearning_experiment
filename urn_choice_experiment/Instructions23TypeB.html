                <li> At the start of every block, the two <b>urns are shuffled anew</b> and <b>then remain in their same position until the end of a given block</b>.</li>

                {% if participant.cognitive_load == 1 %}

                <li> At the beginning of every block, you will be shown a new {{ player.session.length_multi_digit }}-digit number.
                    You don't have to memorize it because it will be shown to you again later when you will be asked to enter it. </li>

                <li> You will then <b>see the urn choices</b> of type <b>A</b> participants of the <b>last of the 4 rounds</b>
                    of a block. </li>
                <li> In some blocks you will see the urn choices of type <b>A</b> participants of

                    {% elif participant.group_assignment == C.GROUP_SQUARE %} <b>triangle</b>

                <li> At the same time, in a given block it can either be very likely <b>(90%)</b> that you <b>share the winning color with your own group</b>, the

                    {% elif participant.group_assignment == C.GROUP_SQUARE %} <b>square</b>
                    {% endif %} group, or it can be very unlikely <b>(10%)</b>.</li>
                <li> Importantly, type <b>A</b> participants of the two groups,
                    <b>triangle and square</b>, earn points for <b>the opposite colour</b>. This means that one of both urns
                    will always be optimal for one group while the opposite urn is optimal for the other group in a given block. </li>

                {% elif participant.cognitive_load == 0 %}

                <li> Finally, you will be shown the number again, and you have to correctly enter it. </li>
